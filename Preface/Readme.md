## Preface

Javascript is a rich language with inbuilt functional nature. It not only support basic functional paradigm, but also has many open source libraries which enhances its functionality.

UnderscoreJS is not an exception to it. The official page of [UnderscoreJs](http://www.underscorejs.org) contains good enough documentation on the helper functions. Nevertheless, as a programmer and a user of UnderscoreJS library, I did went through some of the rough patches while understanding the same.

This eBook is an attempt to create a simple to read and example based usage of the library along with some of the repercussions of using the same in different environments.

This eBook is a reference guide for new comers and experienced programmers alike
